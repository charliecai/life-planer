## Generation Guidelines

1. **Focus on patterns, not chronicles** - Look for recurring themes, not just listing events
2. **Be honest about costs** - Success often comes with hidden trade-offs
3. **Identify root causes** - Go beyond surface explanations
4. **Make it actionable** - Every insight should inform future decisions
5. **Use evidence** - Ground observations in specific examples
6. **Avoid self-judgment** - Frame failures as learning opportunities
7. **Connect to Life Wheel** - Map experiences to the 8 dimensions
8. **Look for systemic issues** - What patterns need structural changes, not just willpower?
