# Annual Review Template

Use this template when generating annual review documents.

**IMPORTANT: For document generation, use Bash heredoc method (see SKILL.md Method 1)**
- This template is ~300 lines, which is too long for Write tool
- **Generate ALL sections in ONE Bash call using { } braces**
- **This ensures only ONE user confirmation is needed (not 12 confirmations)**
- See SKILL.md "Document Generation Process" for detailed instructions

**Batch Execution Format:**
```bash
{
  cat > file.md << 'EOF'
Section 0
EOF

  cat >> file.md << 'EOF'
Section 1
EOF

  # ... all sections
} && echo "✓ Done"
```

## Generation Guidelines

1. **Focus on patterns, not chronicles** - Look for recurring themes, not just listing events
2. **Be honest about costs** - Success often comes with hidden trade-offs
3. **Identify root causes** - Go beyond surface explanations
4. **Make it actionable** - Every insight should inform future decisions
5. **Use evidence** - Ground observations in specific examples
6. **Avoid self-judgment** - Frame failures as learning opportunities
7. **Connect to Life Wheel** - Map experiences to the 8 dimensions
8. **Look for systemic issues** - What patterns need structural changes, not just willpower?
